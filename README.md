# Tkinter-Apps
This repository contains code I used with Tkinter to create apps. It has a fortune cookie generator, text editor, temperature converter, guessing game, and a sci-fi text adventure.

## Fortune Cookie Generator
Users can generate random quotes by clickling "Generate Quote", and it will randomly pick a phrase from a quotes list

## Text Editor
Allows users to write .txt files. They can also upload a .txt file and edit it. Once finished editing, they can save their work as a new .txt file.

## Temperature Converter
Converts a user-inputted temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit.

## Guessing Game
Generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess that number. If the number on the first try was too high/low, the user can guess again. This continues until the user has finally guessed the correct number.

## Sci-fi Text Adventure
Players interact with a Tkinter text adventure where they enter different rooms of a sci-fi ship and collect different items to escape the ship. The commands that are used in this game are:
- go [destination]: Move to a new room. (e.g., Stellar Bridge) 
- take [item]: Pick up an item. (e.g., (take datapad)) 
- look: Look around the current room. 
- inventory: Check your inventory. 
- score: See your current score. 
- help: Display these directions again.
